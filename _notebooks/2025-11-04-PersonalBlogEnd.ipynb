    "At the start of the year, I didn't know how to set up a code, open a terminal, or work in terminal. But now I know how to use Ubuntu, set up WSL, and make games like the one I made a couple weeks ago. At the start of the year, I had trouble understanding how to work in terminal and didn't like it because it didn't have buttons. But now, after all this class, I like working in terminology. It's so easy, simple, and more effective than working in GUI. VS Code used to be my enemy. I used to hate working in VS Code because it's so complicated, so many files. It's just not what I feel like is an ideal working space. But now, it's different because VS Code really allows you to manage what you're working on, use Terminator files, and run some pretty key jokes. "
